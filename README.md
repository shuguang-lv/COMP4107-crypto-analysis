Coursework of COMP4107 Big Data - Crypto Analysis

---

Predicting the stock market or the crypto market is probably one of the most appealing time series prediction problems. Many have attempted various time-series prediction algorithms, and algorithms such as Facebook Prophet or LSTMs seem to be the best performing methods. As such, this is not necessarily Big Data. For this to be Big Data, we need to add more variety and maybe even deal with the velocity. The main challenge with the stock market, in general, is the BIG influence of social media (producing sudden changes) and news going around which make people panic sell (decreasing the price) or buy like crazy (increasing the price). One funny thing about bitcoin is how the entire crypto market tends to fall apart like a house of cards, but sometimes some coins remain stronger (which ones? And why?). In this project, you should investigate the use of Big Data solutions to either predict or understand the crypto market. There are many different things you could do, e.g. classifying time series, clustering them, and using that to later make predictions. But again, the focus shouldn't only be on predicting more accurately, but on the innovative use of Big Data solutions.
